# Project_Portfolio

# Overview

I created this repository to share examples of my data analytics and data science related projects from my studies at The University of Washington, where I recently completed the marketing analytics specialization as part of my marketing degree, in addition to working on a finance degree, a potential minor in informatics and supplementing those studies with additional classes in computer science, information systems and mathematics. Between taking classes spanning C#, Python, R and SQL, plus my own experimentations and self-study I've amassed multiple projects and/or just code samples that I will share in this repository as examples of my work. My overall goal is to pivot out of the technical program management space I've occupied for well over a decade and into a role that's more data analytics or product management related.


# Notes on the typs of projects

* The projects contained in this repository will typically be a mixture of projects I did to develop my skills and projects I did for school
* When a project is for a class, I will note what the original project called for and then how I modified it before sharing it. E.g. redoing a group project for a SQL class in R and/or Python and using different research questions.
* **Languages:** the projects listed will typically be in Python or R, as a learning exercise I will typically re-write the R projects in Python and vice-versa, so there will often two versions of the same projct in this repository.  


# Project List

* NBA Combine: this project attempts to evaluate how useful the "events" at the NBA combine are in terms of evaluating NBA prospects. I.e. does measuring how much a potential NBA player can bench, when coupled with measuring his vertical leap, speed and agility truly give NBA scouts useful information for evaluating a player? Does this data correspond to on court performance?

# Project Portfolio

## Overview

For the past several years I've been working as a *Technical Program-Product manager* in the Seattle Tech Industry, I.e. one of the many who are straddling the worlds of technology as far as feature design or strategy, business and project management. Over the past three years I've spent a fair amount of time developing my technical skills and am now pursuing making a transition into a more technical role, ideally something analytics or product management related that can be a stepping stone to data science if I chose to pursue that route.

I created this repository as a portal to link to my data science specific projects, as not everything that will be pinned from the front page of my GitHub will necessarily be data science related. My objective is to share examples projects related to my data science, marketing analytics and finance studies at The University of Washington, things I've worked on professionally and "tinkering" and data science projects I've done on my own.

## Current Project List

* [NBA Combine:](https://github.com/MarkhamLee/NBA_Combine) this project attempts to evaluate how useful the "events" at the NBA combine are in terms of evaluating NBA prospects. I.e. does measuring how much a potential NBA player can bench, when coupled with measuring his vertical leap, speed and agility truly give NBA scouts useful information for evaluating a player? Does this data correspond to on court performance?
* [Peer to Peer Lending:](https://github.com/MarkhamLee/Lending) companies in this space provide individual investors with the opportunity to invest directly into the consumer credit market, by providing people with the ability to directly invest/fund loans for debt refinancing, small business and major purchases. In a low yield environment peer to peer lending provides an opportunity for high yield fixed income investments, but with that opportunity comes significant risks. This project looks at all of the loans approved and funded by the Lending Club platform in 2015, and attempts to use both general EDA and machine learning models to identify an approach that an investor could use to minimize risk and increase investment returns vs. what could get from just investing in the highest rated loans or a broad cross-section of loans.

## Notes on the types of projects

* The projects contained in this repository will typically be a mixture of projects I did to develop my skills and projects I did for school
* When a project is for a class, I will note what the original project called for and then how I modified it before sharing it. E.g. redoing a group project for a SQL class in R and/or Python or potentially using different research questions.

## Languages

* The projects listed will typically be in Python or R
* In some cases I will re-write the R projects in Python and vice-versa as a learning exercise, so there will often two versions of the same project in this repository

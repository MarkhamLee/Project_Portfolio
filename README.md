# Project Portfolio

## Overview

I created this repository to share examples of my data analytics and data science related projects from my finance and marketing analytics and related studies at The University of Washington, as well as "tinkering" and data projects I've done on my own. Between taking classes spanning C#, Python, R and SQL, plus my own experimentations and self-study I've amassed multiple projects and/or code samples that I will share in this repository as examples of my work. My overall goal is to pivot out of the technical program management space I've occupied for well over a decade and into a role that's more data analytics or product management related.

## Notes on the types of projects

* The projects contained in this repository will typically be a mixture of projects I did to develop my skills and projects I did for school
* When a project is for a class, I will note what the original project called for and then how I modified it before sharing it. E.g. redoing a group project for a SQL class in R and/or Python and potentially using different research questions.

## Languages

* The projects listed will typically be in Python or R
* In some cases I will re-write the R projects in Python and vice-versa as a learning exercise, so there will often two versions of the same project in this repository  

## Current Project List

* [NBA Combine:](https://github.com/MarkhamLee/Project_Portfolio/tree/master/NBA/NBA_Combine_V1) this project attempts to evaluate how useful the "events" at the NBA combine are in terms of evaluating NBA prospects. I.e. does measuring how much a potential NBA player can bench, when coupled with measuring his vertical leap, speed and agility truly give NBA scouts useful information for evaluating a player? Does this data correspond to on court performance?
* [Peer to Peer Lending:](https://github.com/MarkhamLee/LendingClub) companies in this space provide individual investors with the opportunity to invest directly into the consumer credit market, by providing people with the ability to directly invest/fund loans for debt refinancing, small business and major purchases. In a low yield environment peer to peer lending provides an opportunity for high yield fixed income investments, but with that opportunity comes significant risks. This project looks at all of the loans approved and funded by the Lending Club platform in 2015, and attempts to use both general EDA and machine learning models to identify an approach that an investor could use to minimize risks since the losses from a single defaulted loan can exceed the returns from 2-3 paid off loans.

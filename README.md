# Project_Portfolio

# Overview

I created this repository to share examples of my data analytics and data science related projects from my studies at The University of Washington, where I recently completed the marketing analytics specialization as part of my marketing degree, in addition to working on a finance degree, a potential minor in informatics and supplementing those studies with additional classes in computer science, information systems and mathematics. Between taking classes spanning C#, Python, R and SQL, plus my own experimentations and self-study I've amassed multiple projects and/or just code samples that I will share in this repository as examples of my work. Part of the genesis for this repository was looking through the sheer number of data analysis projects I've done for various classes that would be good examples of my work as either an analyst or budding data scientist. My overall goal is to pivot out of the technical program management space I've occupied for well over a decade and into a role that's more data analytics or product management related.


# Notes on the typs of projects

* The projects contained in this repository will typically be a mixture of projects I did to develop my skills and projects I did for school
* When a project is for a class, I will note what the original project called for and then how I modified it before sharing it. E.g. redoing a group project for a SQL class in R and/or Python and using different research questions.
* **Languages:** the projects listed will typically be in Python or R, as a learning exercise I will typically re-write the R projects in Python and vice-versa, so there will often two versions of the same project in this repository.  


# Project List

* NBA Combine: this project attempts to evaluate how useful the "events" at the NBA combine are in terms of evaluating NBA prospects. I.e. does measuring how much a potential NBA player can bench, when coupled with measuring his vertical leap, speed and agility truly give NBA scouts useful information for evaluating a player? Does this data correspond to on court performance?
